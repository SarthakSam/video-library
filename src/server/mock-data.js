        description: "Welcome to neogcamp's first class. This is the most basic class you'll find on programming. We will use JavaScript to code. Using nodeJS we will write a CLI (Command Line Interface) program. We'll then use https://repl.itâ€‹ to host it. For intermediate to advanced developers, this class would be too basic. Therefore, you can skip this and directly make the app for the camp's submission for levelOne.",

        description: "Welcome to neogcamp's second class. For a newbie to self host his/her first website and program more apps we need some tooling to be in place. Tools help you make your life easier. All these tools are free for you and will give you a better place to code, a place to store your code in the cloud so that you don't lose it, and then a place to host your app so that others can find it. This session will set you up for the next class where we'll develop our very own portfolio website and blog. The blog part will be an assignment but I'll help you with that. For intermediate to advanced developers, if you already know how to use Git, Github, VSCode, Netlify, etc to do web development you can skip this class.",
